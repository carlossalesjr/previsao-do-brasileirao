> A Python script that runs a simulation of the remainder of the Brazilian Football Championship season, projecting a possible final league table. This project uses web scraping to gather up-to-date data from Wikipedia and applies a statistical model based on the Poisson Distribution to predict the outcome of each remaining match.
